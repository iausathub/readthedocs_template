Template for the Read the Docs tutorial
=======================================

This GitHub template includes a fictional Python library
with some basic Sphinx documentation.

The sample documentation website is here:

https://sathub-documentation-example.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

Read the tutorial here:

https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/

Note that the "main" branch needs to be called "master" for the automated compilation to work out of the box.
